## What Was Built

**The 6-7 Oracle** - A mystical oracle that answers life's questions in the chaotic language of Gen Alpha.

This project celebrates Dictionary.com's 2025 Word of the Year: "6-7" (six-seven). The term emerged from TikTok and Gen Alpha culture, meaning everything and nothing - a perfectly ambiguous response to any situation.

## Why This Idea

### Trend Research Highlights
- "6-7" was Dictionary.com's **2025 Word of the Year**
- Top trending Google search for "what does...mean" and "hand gesture"
- The phrase has been banned in schools worldwide
- British PM Keir Starmer apologized for doing the gesture at a school
- Parents everywhere are baffled - perfect viral potential

### The Insight
The phrase's intentional meaninglessness is PERFECT for an oracle. Traditional oracles give cryptic, open-to-interpretation wisdom. Gen Alpha "wisdom" is deliberately ambiguous. The mashup writes itself.

## Features

### Core Experience
- Ask any question, receive chaotic Gen Alpha wisdom
- Topic-aware responses (detects love, money, work, future, meaning questions)
- 45+ unique oracle responses

### Visual Design
- Dark mystical purple/blue gradient background
- Glowing orb with "67" that pulses and animates
- Floating particles and stars
- Shimmer text effects on the title
- Smooth reveal animations for responses

### Interactions
- Type question and press Enter or click button
- Dramatic 1.5-3 second "channeling" animation while thinking
- Share button (uses Web Share API on mobile, clipboard on desktop)
- Session counter for questions asked

### Gen Alpha Slang Integration
Responses incorporate:
- "no cap", "fr fr", "lowkey"
- "sigma", "rizz", "NPC", "main character"
- "skibidi", "ohio", "gyatt"
- "mid", "slay", "valid"
- And of course, constant references to 6-7

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + custom CSS animations
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Analytics**: Vercel Analytics

## Sample Oracle Responses

> "The path you seek is neither 6 nor 7, but somewhere in between, no cap fr fr."

> "Your rizz is strong, but the universe needs you to lock in harder than a 6-7."

> "In the cosmic ledger, you are neither NPC nor main character - you are 6-7."

> "The oracle has consulted the ancient texts of TikTok. The answer remains 6-7."

> "Why are we here? To experience the full spectrum from 6 to 7 and back again."

## What Makes It Extraordinary

1. **Perfect timing** - Riding the wave of "6-7" being named Word of the Year
2. **Generational gap humor** - Adults will be confused, kids will be delighted
3. **Genuinely funny responses** - Not just random slang, actual comedic writing
4. **Beautiful aesthetic** - The mystical oracle vibe meets internet chaos
5. **Shareable** - Easy to screenshot or share responses
6. **Zero API keys needed** - Fully client-side, instant deployment

## Potential Virality Vectors

- Parents sharing with "can anyone explain what this means?"
- Teachers using it to connect with students
- Twitter/X screenshots of the funniest responses
- TikTok reactions to the oracle's wisdom
- "Ask the 6-7 Oracle about [topic]" format

## What Could Be Added Later

- Voice synthesis for the oracle
- More response categories (sports, gaming, school)
- History of questions asked
- Daily "prophecy" that changes each day
- Leaderboard of most shared responses

## Lessons Learned

- Gen Alpha slang is surprisingly deep and interconnected
- The "6-7" meme's intentional meaninglessness is perfect oracle material
- Client-side randomization is sufficient for this type of experience
- Custom CSS animations > libraries for unique effects

## The Vibe Check

**Would I share this with friends?** Absolutely. The responses are genuinely funny and the aesthetic is on point. It perfectly captures the absurdity of "6-7" culture while being accessible to everyone.
