  - Been banned in schools
  - British PM apologized for doing the gesture
  - Parents are baffled worldwide
  - It's a generational insider code

## Candidates

### 1. The 6-7 Oracle

- **Why now?**: 6-7 is literally Dictionary.com's 2025 Word of the Year. It's THE meme.
- **Novel because**: Nobody has built an AI oracle that responds exclusively in chaotic Gen Alpha energy. It's satire meets utility meets pure chaos.
- **Shareability**: HIGH - People will screenshot hilarious responses, parents will send to understand their kids
- **Tech angle**: Can use browser APIs for fun interactions, maybe voice synthesis, particle effects for the "mystical" vibe
- **Buildability**: Easy-Medium

### 2. Labubu Rarity Calculator
- **The hook**: "Find out how rare your Labubu is and what it's worth"
- **Why now?**: Labubu is at all-time search highs, $170K auction sale, celebrities showing them off

- **Shareability**: Medium-High - Collectors would share their "wins"
- **Tech angle**: Could scrape/aggregate data, build a collection tracker
- **Buildability**: Hard (need data, images, etc.)
- **Requires API keys**: Maybe for images

### 3. "Am I Brainrotted?" Quiz
- **The hook**: "Take this quiz to find out your brain rot level based on what slang you know"
- **Why now?**: Brain rot was Oxford's 2024 Word of the Year, ties into 6-7 trend
- **Novel because**: Interactive quiz that's actually fun and generationally divided
- **Shareability**: HIGH - People love sharing quiz results
- **Tech angle**: Fun animations, shareable result cards
- **Buildability**: Easy
- **Requires API keys**: No

### 4. DeepSeek vs ChatGPT Arena
- **The hook**: "Watch AI models battle in real-time on any prompt you give them"

### 5. Gorilla vs 100 Men Simulator

- **Buildability**: Medium-Hard
- **Requires API keys**: No

### 6. The Vibe Check Oracle
- **The hook**: "Get your vibes checked by an AI that actually understands the timeline"
- **Why now?**: Searches for "Tell me about..." up 70%, conversational AI is mainstream
- **Novel because**: Personality-driven AI that gives brutally honest vibe assessments
- **Shareability**: HIGH - People love being "read"
- **Tech angle**: Could be pure client-side with clever writing
- **Buildability**: Easy-Medium
- **Requires API keys**: No

## Decision

**Building**: The 6-7 Oracle

**Why this one**:
1. "6-7" is literally THE cultural moment - Dictionary.com's Word of the Year
2. The absurdity is perfect for going viral - it's meaningless BY DESIGN
3. Parents are desperately trying to understand this, kids think it's hilarious
4. No API keys needed - can build something delightful with pure frontend magic
5. The visual potential is huge - mystical oracle aesthetic meets chaotic Gen Alpha energy
6. It's genuinely funny and weird in a way that's memorable
7. Highly shareable - people will screenshot responses

**The vision**:
A mystical, slightly unhinged oracle that answers life's questions in the chaotic language of Gen Alpha. Beautiful particle effects, dramatic animations, the oracle "channels the energy of 6-7" before delivering wisdom that ranges from profound-sounding nonsense to accidentally insightful chaos.

Every response incorporates "6-7" naturally and other Gen Alpha slang (skibidi, rizz, sigma, ohio, etc.) but in a way that feels like genuine oracle wisdom filtered through the internet's most absurd generation.

The aesthetic: Dark mystical purple/blue gradients, floating particles, a glowing orb that pulses with each answer, dramatic reveal animations. Think "ancient mystical energy" meets "iPad kid consciousness."
